# Reference

Complete reference for all commands and features of the Odoo Dev Environment Template.

For practical step-by-step scenarios (upgrade loop, two clients simultaneously, etc.)
see [WORKFLOWS.md](WORKFLOWS.md).

> Throughout this document, `acme` is used as a placeholder company name in examples.
> Replace it with the actual client name in every command.

> **Note on wkhtmltopdf:** Odoo's Docker images ship wkhtmltopdf pre-configured at
> the exact version each release requires. On macOS natively, the common workaround
> is to render reports via Odoo's `/report/html/` route, which produces inconsistent
> results. Inside the container, wkhtmltopdf runs natively on Linux and renders PDFs
> directly — matching the behavior of a production server.

```

---

## Initial setup

Run `setup.sh` once per machine to create the directory structure, clone the vault
repositories, and create the initial worktrees.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script is safe to re-run — existing directories and repos are skipped.

### Using local donors to speed up vault cloning

Cloning bare repos from GitHub can take a long time (~13 GB for `odoo` alone).
If you already have a regular clone of a repo on your machine, you can use it as
a **donor** — `setup.sh` will create the bare repo locally using hardlinks (instant,
no network) and then only fetch the delta from GitHub.

When the script reaches the vault cloning step, answer `y` to the donor prompt and
provide the path to each existing clone. Leave a field empty to download that repo
from GitHub normally.

**What happens under the hood:**

```bash
# 1. Clone bare from donor using hardlinks (instant)
git clone --bare --local ~/odoo-donor ~/Odoo/.vault/odoo.git

# 2. Point the remote to GitHub
git -C ~/Odoo/.vault/odoo.git remote set-url origin git@github.com:odoo/odoo.git

# 3. Set the correct bare-repo fetch refspec
git -C ~/Odoo/.vault/odoo.git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"

# 4. Fetch only what's missing
git -C ~/Odoo/.vault/odoo.git fetch origin '+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*' --prune
```

> **Disk space:** The donor approach has the same final footprint as a direct
> `--bare` clone from GitHub. Donors can be safely deleted once `setup.sh` finishes —
> the script will offer to do this automatically.

> **Common mistake:** Do not configure the fetch refspec as
> `+refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*`. When a branch is checked out in a worktree (e.g.
> `18.0`), Git refuses to fetch into it — even when you are creating a completely
> different version. Always use `refs/remotes/origin/*` as the destination so fetched
> refs never conflict with checked-out worktrees.

---

## Managing worktrees

Use `make worktree-add` / `make worktree-remove` to add or remove Odoo source
worktrees after the initial setup. This is the recommended way to add new versions —
including `saas-*` branches — without re-running `setup.sh`.

```bash
make worktree-add VERSION=19.0
make worktree-add VERSION=saas-18.4
make worktree-remove VERSION=17.0
make worktree                        # interactive menu
```

The script fetches the latest refs from the vault before creating a worktree, copies
the appropriate Dockerfile based on the major version number (`legacy` / Python 3.10
for < 18.0, including `saas-16.*` and `saas-17.*`; `modern` / Python 3.12 for ≥ 18.0
and `saas-18.*` and above), and registers the worktree removal cleanly with git when
deleting.

> **Important:** The `.vault/` directory must always be located at `~/Odoo/.vault`.
> This path is mounted into the container at its exact host location so that git worktree
> pointers resolve correctly inside the container — required for GitLens to show
> blame and history on Odoo source files.

---

## Debugging

The environment runs `debugpy` on port `5678`. To attach the debugger:

**1. Open the project folder in VS Code**

```bash
code ~/Odoo/Customers/acme
```

**2. Reopen in container**

When prompted by the Dev Containers extension, click **Reopen in Container**.
If the prompt does not appear, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run:
`Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

This connects VS Code to the running Odoo container. All workspace paths
(`/mnt/reference`, `/mnt/extra-addons`) resolve from inside the container —
the workspace file will not work without this step.

**3. Open the workspace file**

Once inside the container, open `odoo-dev.code-workspace` to load all folders.
Then use the **Docker: Odoo Debug** launch configuration to attach the debugger.

> **Debugger not working on first try?**
> VS Code needs a moment to finish activating extensions after attaching to the
> container. Wait until the status bar stops spinning and the Python interpreter
> is shown in the bottom-right corner, then try the debugger again.

> **Running multiple clients simultaneously?**
> Change `ODOO_PORT`, `ODOO_DEBUG_PORT`, and `PGADMIN_PORT` in each client's
> `.env` to avoid port conflicts (e.g. `8069`/`5678`/`5050` for one,
> `8070`/`5679`/`5051` for another).
> Each VS Code window connects to its own container independently.

## Hot reload

To enable hot reload during development, add `--dev=all` to `ODOO_EXTRA_ARGS` in your `.env`:

```
ODOO_EXTRA_ARGS=--dev=all
```

---

## Testing

Three commands are available depending on the level of granularity needed:

| Command          | Flag                          | When to use                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `make test`      | `--test-enable`               | Upgrade a module and run all tests      |
| `make test-tags` | `--test-tags` (self-enabling) | Target a specific tag, class or method  |
| `make test-file` | `--test-file`                 | Run all tests in a specific Python file |

**Examples**

```bash
# Upgrade and run all tests for a module
make test modules=acme_sale

# Run a specific test class
make test-tags tags=/acme_sale:TestSaleOrder

# Run a single test method
make test-tags tags=/acme_sale:TestSaleOrder.test_create

# Run all tests in a file
make test-file file=/mnt/extra-addons/acme_sale/tests/test_sale_order.py
```

> `--test-file` is available from Odoo 15 onwards.

## ORM Shell / psql

Two ways to interact directly with the running environment without a GUI.

### `make shell` — Odoo ORM shell

Opens a Python REPL with the Odoo `env` variable pre-loaded and connected to
the active database. Changes run inside a transaction that is rolled back on
exit — use `env.cr.commit()` to persist them.

```python
# Example: add an exclamation mark to all partner names
records = env["res.partner"].search([])
for partner in records:
    partner.name = "%s !" % partner.name
env.cr.commit()
```

### `make psql` — PostgreSQL shell

Opens a `psql` session directly against the active database. Useful for raw
SQL queries, schema inspection, or debugging without launching pgAdmin.

```sql
-- Example: check the number of partners
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM res_partner;
```

---

## pgAdmin4

pgAdmin4 is included as an optional service for database inspection. It is not
started by default — only when explicitly requested.

```bash
make pgadmin
# → http://localhost:${PGADMIN_PORT:-5050}  (admin@admin.com / admin)
```

### When to use it during an upgrade

**Comparing schemas between versions**

- Before and after an upgrade, inspect the real database schema — column types,
  constraints, indexes — and verify that the migration scripts transformed the
  data correctly.

**Debugging SQL errors**

- When a migration fails with a PostgreSQL error, pgAdmin lets you run raw SQL
  queries against the database to reproduce and diagnose the problem without
  restarting the full upgrade process.

**Analyzing performance issues**

- If Odoo is slow after an upgrade, use the query analysis tools to identify
  missing indexes or inefficient queries introduced by the new version.

**Inspecting data after a restore**

- After `make restore`, quickly verify that the dump was restored correctly —
  row counts, field values, related records — before starting the upgrade iteration.

---

## Operating mode

The environment supports two modes, controlled by `ODOO_MODE` in your `.env`:

### `development` (default)

Single Odoo version mounted read-only at `/mnt/reference`. Use this for custom
module development, new module creation, and bugfixes on a running production version.

Required `.env` variables: `ODOO_VERSION`

### `upgrade`

Two versions mounted simultaneously. Use this when migrating custom modules
between Odoo versions.

- **Target** (`/opt/odoo-src`) — the version being upgraded to (runs Odoo)
- **Source** (`/mnt/reference`) — the version being upgraded from, read-only

Required `.env` variables: `ODOO_SOURCE_VERSION`, `ODOO_TARGET_VERSION`

### Switching modes

Change `ODOO_MODE` in your `.env` and restart:

```bash
# In .env
ODOO_MODE=upgrade

make restart-all
```

## Database reset

Use `make reset` to reset the database. This drops any existing database,
creates a new one, and installs the `base` module with `--stop-after-init`.
Run `make start` afterwards to launch Odoo normally.

Use `make restore dump=file.dump` to restore from an existing dump instead.
Do not put `-i base` in `ODOO_EXTRA_ARGS` — it would reinstall the base module
on every startup. `ODOO_EXTRA_ARGS` is reserved for arguments that apply on
every run (e.g. `--dev=all`).

---

## Troubleshooting

### `make start` says the image does not exist but it does

`make start` looks for an image named exactly `odoo-dev:<version>`. Two things can cause this error even when the image appears to be present.

**The image has a different name or tag**

The Makefile only accepts `odoo-dev:<version>`. If you built or pulled the image under a different name, tag it:

```bash
docker tag <your-image> odoo-dev:19.0
```

**The image was built under a different Docker context**

Docker Desktop on Mac runs two contexts (`default` and `desktop-linux`) backed by different Unix sockets. An image built in one context may not be visible to the other due to a known Docker Desktop inconsistency with `docker image inspect`.

`make start` now detects this automatically. If the image exists in another context, the error message will tell you exactly which one and offer two options:

```
Found in context 'default' but active context is 'desktop-linux'.
Option 1: switch context →  docker context use default
Option 2: rebuild here   →  make build
```

Option 1 is instant. Option 2 rebuilds the image in the current context (preferred if you want to stay on `desktop-linux`).
