## Managing worktrees

Use `worktree.sh` to add or remove Odoo source worktrees after the initial setup.
This is the recommended way to add new versions — including `saas-*` branches —
without re-running the full `setup.sh`.

**Interactive mode**

```bash
bash worktree.sh
```

Presents a menu to add or remove a worktree.

**Non-interactive mode**

```bash
bash worktree.sh add 18.0
bash worktree.sh add saas-18.4
bash worktree.sh remove 17.0
```

The script fetches the latest refs from the vault before creating a worktree, copies
the appropriate Dockerfile based on the major version number (`legacy` / Python 3.10
for < 18.0, including `saas-16.*` and `saas-17.*`; `modern` / Python 3.12 for ≥ 18.0
and `saas-18.*` and above), and registers the worktree removal cleanly with git when
deleting.

> **Important:** The `.vault/` directory must always be located at `~/Odoo/.vault`.
> This path is mounted into the container at its exact host location so that git worktree
> pointers resolve correctly inside the container — required for GitLens to show
> blame and history on Odoo source files.

---

## Debugging

The environment runs `debugpy` on port `5678`. To attach the debugger:

**1. Open the project folder in VS Code**

```bash
code ~/Odoo/Customers/acme
```

**2. Reopen in container**

When prompted by the Dev Containers extension, click **Reopen in Container**.
If the prompt does not appear, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run:
`Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

This connects VS Code to the running Odoo container. All workspace paths
(`/opt/odoo-src`, `/mnt/reference`, `/mnt/extra-addons`) resolve from inside
the container — the workspace file will not work without this step.

**3. Open the workspace file**

Once inside the container, open `odoo-dev.code-workspace` to load all folders.
Then use the **Docker: Odoo Debug** launch configuration to attach the debugger.

> **Debugger not working? `Cannot activate 'Python Debugger'` error?**
> Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `Developer: Reload Window`.
> This reinitializes the extension host and resolves the activation order issue
> between the Python and Debugpy extensions.

> **Running multiple clients simultaneously?**
> Change `ODOO_PORT` and `ODOO_DEBUG_PORT` in each client's `.env` to avoid
> port conflicts (e.g. `8069`/`5678` for one, `8070`/`5679` for another).
> Each VS Code window connects to its own container independently.

## Hot reload

To enable hot reload during development, add `--dev=all` to `ODOO_EXTRA_ARGS` in your `.env`:

```
ODOO_EXTRA_ARGS=--dev=all
```

---

## Testing

Three commands are available depending on the level of granularity needed:

| Command | Flag | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `make test` | `--test-enable` | Upgrade a module and run all its tests |
| `make test-tags` | `--test-tags` (self-enabling) | Target a specific tag, class or method |
| `make test-file` | `--test-file` | Run all tests in a specific Python file |

**Examples**

```bash
# Upgrade and run all tests for a module
make test modules=acme_sale

# Run a specific test class
make test-tags tags=/acme_sale:TestSaleOrder

# Run a single test method
make test-tags tags=/acme_sale:TestSaleOrder.test_create

# Run all tests in a file
make test-file file=/mnt/extra-addons/acme_sale/tests/test_sale_order.py
```

> `--test-file` is available from Odoo 15 onwards.

## pgAdmin4

pgAdmin4 is included as an optional service for database inspection. It is not
started by default — only when explicitly requested.

```bash
make pgadmin
# → http://localhost:5050  (admin@admin.com / admin)
```

### When to use it during an upgrade

**Comparing schemas between versions**
- Before and after an upgrade, inspect the real database schema — column types,
  constraints, indexes — and verify that the migration scripts transformed the
  data correctly.

**Debugging SQL errors**
- When a migration fails with a PostgreSQL error, pgAdmin lets you run raw SQL
  queries against the database to reproduce and diagnose the problem without
  restarting the full upgrade process.

**Analyzing performance issues**
- If Odoo is slow after an upgrade, use the query analysis tools to identify
  missing indexes or inefficient queries introduced by the new version.

**Inspecting data after a restore**
- After `make restore`, quickly verify that the dump was restored correctly —
  row counts, field values, related records — before starting the upgrade iteration.

---

## Upgrade workflow

The environment mounts two versions of Odoo simultaneously:

- **Target** (`/opt/odoo-src`) — the version you are upgrading to
- **Source** (`/mnt/reference`) — the version you are upgrading from, read-only

Both are visible in the VS Code workspace for side-by-side comparison without switching branches.
